# Leo's UNIX Dev Environment

nvim + tmux + bash setup for my own personal needs. Supports, out of the box:

* typescript
* javascript
* rust
* python
* go
* html / css / less
* markdown
* tmux / nvim integration
* language server protocol
* code review helpers

Tested on OSX. Requires Python 3.7.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/leolimasa/unix-dev-env 
unix-dev-env/install.sh
```

## Basic Usage

* Run a tmux session by doing `tmux`
* Run `tmux-newwindow [folder]` to open a new project at the folder

## Features

* Put desired features into `UDE_FEATURES` if you wish to limit what gets installed
  * Ex.: `UDE_FEATURES=python,rust install.sh`
* Put features that you want excluded into `UDE_EXCLUDE_FEATURES` if you want to install all but a few
  * Ex.: `UDE_EXCLUDE_FEATURES=go install.sh`
* See the `ude/features` folder for all available features. Each file is a feature name.

## Tips

* `tmux-newwindow` sets the env variable `PR` (project root) to the folder pass as the argument.
  * That allows you to use $PR to refer to the project root anywhere. Ex.: `nvim $PR/src/test.ts`
